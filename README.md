# ProjectMP

A Java multiplayer framework/game using libGDX. It has a lot of framework stuff that assists in making multiplayer easy to implement for future features.

This project is essentially done as of July 31/2015. It has all the framework I needed and a different project will be picked up.

Feel free to clone/fork the project and submit features/bugfixes in a pull request. You can import this project as a Gradle Project in Eclipse (I don't know what it's like in other IDEs but it's something along the lines of a Gradle project).
